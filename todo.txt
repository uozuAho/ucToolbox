Now:
 *  Read up on namespaces. May be good to put all library code within a namespace
 *  Same for templates. Buffers may be better with templates. Look for existing 
    templates. EASTL, STL, some other template lib?
Later:
 *  Define some constraints of the library, probably:
    - No dynamic memory usage (or explicitly state when used)
    - Exceptions?
