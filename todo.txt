 - Use stdio.h for streams for now. Make Stream class only if stdio is too big or something...
 - Needed for initial embedded testing:
    - UART class
 - Use STL where reasonable. Must use a permissively-licensed implementation:
  -- stdlibc++ (gnu) - no
  -- uclibc++ - no
  -- libc++ (clang) - yes, currently maintained, supports c++11, winner!
  -- uSTL - yes, partial implementation
  -- apache libc++ - yes, no updates since 2008
